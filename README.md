A python script that connects to the [vulners.com](https://gist.github.com/athityakumar/1bd5e9e24cd2a1891565573a893993eb) API to pull in all security vulnerabilities that apply to your setup.
\
This is the backend responsible for the following:-

- Connecting to the API to get a list of all the types of vulnerabilities i.e. Cisco, Linux, Windows etc.
- Putting these into a SQLite DB so that they can be selected or deselected from the frontend
- Downloading the relevant .zip files from vulners and storing them in a folder to be accessed by the front end.
